# Programming assignment grader

Provides an endpoint for a large language model (a small model with poor quality responses included), an API endpoint starter for the QA platform, and an UI starter for the QA platform.

Starting the application up for the first time may take a while, as it also downloads the (small) large language model (approx. 250 megabytes) and packages it into an image.

The application grades submission to Python programming tasks.

The application can be started using the command `docker compose up`

Some system may require super user privileges so the command will then be `sudo docker compose up`
